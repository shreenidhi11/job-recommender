This project is a Full-stack Employment Recommendation System. I have worked and engineered a job recommendation platform with AWS S3 for static frontend hosting and an EC2 instance for backend processing. The platform enables fast resume analysis and role matching with personalized upskilling plans. I have optimized K-Means clustering using TF-IDF and Word2Vec vectorization, combined with Cosine, Jaccard, and Euclidean distance metrics, achieving 90% recommendation accuracy across 22 job domains.
